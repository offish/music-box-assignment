# ABC Player - Group 1

## Our Group:
- Christopher Daffinrud
- Ole Eirik Solberg Seljordslia
- Aditi Deshpande
- Hannes Weigel
- Oscar Melby
- Shahin Ostadahmadi

## Objective
We wanted to create an ABC-player where we could write in musical notations in the terminal.
The notes we wanted to play is as follows:
- Lower Octave: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h
- Higher Octage: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H

The Enter-key is to be used for as the trigger for playing the notes that has been entered up until the Enter-key is read from memory.

## Components and Division Of Labor
To create this functionality we figured we needed several components for our project that we divided between our group members:
- UART with Baud Rate Generator (Ole)
- RAM with an Adress Counter (Hannes)
- Code converter (Oscar)
- Mod-m counter (Aditi)
- Flip Flop (Aditi)
- Timer (Oscar)
- Control Path (Shahin and Christopher)

## Diagrams

We created diagrams before we started to implement the components: 

1. FSMD Chart (Aditi)
2. ASMD Chart (Shahin and Christopher)

These were created and used as a blueprint for trying to make sure that we all were on the same logical track.

## Result
